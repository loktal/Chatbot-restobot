#Messenger chatbot for Restobot restaurant.

Hello, I developed a messenger chatbot for an imaginary restaurant named Restobot.
I invite you to try it on this facebook page. If facebook gives me the authorization to deploy it, it should work fine. https://www.facebook.com/Restobot-104819101692885


So the main idea of this chatbot is to make the life of Restobot's customers easier.
With this chatbot the user can see the menus, info on the restaurant and even reserve a table in function of his party size and when he wants to reserve.


The chatbot is really easy to test, but I invite you to see the video I made of me testing the chatbot and explaining how it works. First if it is the first time you interact with the chatbot (or if you deleted the last messages) , the chatbot will guide you on the menus, or if you want to reserve a table. You just have to follow the indications of the chatbot. If you want to reserve a table, the chatbot will ask you when you want to reserve, then what is your party size and finally ask you for your phone number (if facebook knows your phone number, you have a quick response with it but you still can write it by yourself.). Finally, the chatbot will send you a message with the info of your reservation and point out that the reservation is done.

If you have already reserve with our chatbot and you want to re do the experiment you can ask him questions like "I want to see the menu" and it will show you the menus. And if you want to reserve directly you can ask him "I want to reserve a table." (You don't have to copy past theses sentences, if work even if you say it a bit differently.)



I know it is a bit tricky to see clearly how it works with just words, so I try it by yourself (if facebook accepts to deploy it) or the my video of me trying it, but don't forget to enjoy.
